# Bifr√∂st

The Bifrost Bridge fork running optimized for Kubernetes charting, and customized to run on aria-net.org, the code is updated from upstream and adapted for use on Aria Network infrastructure.
Usage in production in other environments is highly unsuggested and we don't provide any kind of support for it.

## Service support

You can get support for the Aria Network bridge instance in [#bifrost:aria-net.org](https://matrix.to/#/#bifrost:aria-net.org)
